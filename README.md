# QuizLite

Tool to administrate quiz.
It allows for the moderator to see 
the questions as well as notes and 
for the players to see the screen 
with the questions.

This was done as personal challenge, to create single file project. 
Author knows that this is not the best practice, not even good practice. 
This is hardly "good enough", but it was done for personal use, so I do not care.
